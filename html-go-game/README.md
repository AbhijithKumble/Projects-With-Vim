Game Title: "Shadow Shifter"
Concept

You control a character in a 2D environment, but you can only interact with the shadows of the objects in the game. The objects themselves are static and unmovable, but by shifting a light source, you can manipulate the size, position, and orientation of their shadows to solve puzzles and progress through levels.
Gameplay Mechanics

    Character Movement:
        Use arrow keys or WASD to move your character within the shadow world.
        Jump and crouch to navigate obstacles.

    Light Manipulation:
        Drag and drop the light source with your mouse to adjust its angle and distance.
        This changes how shadows fall, creating platforms, bridges, or blocking hazards.

    Dynamic Shadows:
        Shadows interact with the environment, and you must manipulate them creatively:
            Make shadows longer to reach platforms.
            Block harmful zones with shadows of solid objects.
            Combine multiple light sources to create overlapping or missing shadows.

    Physics:
        Shadows can act as soft or hard surfaces depending on the object's material (e.g., glass objects create passable shadows).

Level Design Ideas

    Obstacle Courses: Navigate through a maze of static objects by carefully adjusting the light.
    Puzzles: Use shadows to activate switches or align patterns to open doors.
    Enemies: Add enemies that can only move through the shadowed areas, forcing you to manipulate light strategically.

Unique Features

    Visual Style: Minimalistic and elegant, focusing on contrasting light and shadow with a monochromatic or dual-tone color palette.
    Dynamic Difficulty: Start with a single light source and progress to multiple lights, rotating objects, and time-sensitive challenges.
    Replay Value: Levels can have multiple solutions, encouraging experimentation.

This concept is relatively unexplored and can be both visually stunning and mentally engaging. Itâ€™s also perfect for showcasing the capabilities of HTML Canvas for dynamic rendering and physics!
